Pokedex Completion Rewards for Cobblemon 1.6!

Requires GooeyLibs & Cobblemon!

Adds the /dex command, subcommands are /dex reload and /dex rewards. The permission node for /dex reload is dexrewards.reload.

In the config you can currently add 21 rewards to claim based on Pokedex completion percentage (as I didn't want to add pages at this point). You can add both item rewards and command rewards, and multiple rewards per reward category. The reward categories available to a player are updated when a player catches a Pok√©mon, relogs, or when the mod is reloaded.

This mod was not originally intended to be public, so it's not super customizable, and won't be unless people want it to be, pages are also not out of the question if requested enough.

Players claim rewards from the /dex rewards GUI, they'll receive a chat message informing them that a new reward is available, the GUI will highlight claimable rewards, and inform the player of other requirements for rewards.
